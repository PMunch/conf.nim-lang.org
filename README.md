![NimConf 2020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PMunch/conf.nim-lang.org/master/nim-conf-menace2.svg)
This is intended to be the website for the Nim conference 2020. It's just a
super simple site built with Skeletal (feel free to use the `variables.css` file
from this library to build your own Nim-looking sites).
